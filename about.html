                    Motique began dancing at the age of three, after watching her big sister attending dance classes saying "I can do that". Her training led her to win titles in multiple regional and national dance competitions. She won numerous scholarships with Joe Tremaine as well as assisting Frank Hatchet in NYC. She also had the opportunity to perform in Broadway Dance Centers Showcase, choreographed by Michelle Barber. Out of the entire state of Pennsylvania, she was one of ten chosen to attend the prestigious Governor's School for the Arts.

                    Professionally her dance career has taken her around the world. Motique began by performing as a lead singer/dancer on Holland America Cruise Lines. She then performed in regional theatres in numerous states for ten years. While performing in Florida she had the opportunity to step off the stage and on to the baseball field, to sing the National Anthem for the Minnesota Twins on several occasions.
