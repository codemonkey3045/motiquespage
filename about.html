                    Motique began dancing at the age of three, after watching her big sister attending dance classes saying "I can do that". Her training led her to win titles in multiple regional and national dance competitions. She won numerous scholarships with Joe Tremaine as well as assisting Frank Hatchet in NYC. She also had the opportunity to perform in Broadway Dance Centers Showcase, choreographed by Michelle Barber. Out of the entire state of Pennsylvania, she was one of ten chosen to attend the prestigious Governor's School for the Arts.
